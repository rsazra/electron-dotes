# electron-dotes

Dotes is an extremely simple daily notes/journaling app partially inspired by [rednotebook](https://rednotebook.sourceforge.io/).

Start off by selecting where to store your journal. Then, every day you open the app, the day's entry is created and the time of opening is logged for you. From there, type whatever you'd like, and save with Command/Control + S, or from the menu bar. For now, this is all Dotes does, but much more is planned for the future.
